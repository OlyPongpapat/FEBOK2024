# **About Us.**

### **This is our team.**


  We are team YBR-BOK. We are a team from Yothinburana School in Bangkok, Thailand. Our team is comprised of 3 members; Pawit Nateenantasawasd, Pongpapat Putongkam, and Thanyawut Krittikanon.
For the past 4 years, we have been good friends, classmates, and teammates. Last year, our first time competing in this WRO category, we got lucky and had a chance to compete in the international round. But we are not careful enough, our rookie mistake gets us only in 8th place. This year we hope to get one more chance before the regulations change to redeem ourselves.

Programmer: Pawit Nateenantasawasd </p>
Mechanic: Pongpapat Putongkam </p>
Support: Thanyawut Krittikanon </p>

</p>

  Our team has 3 major positions. Firstly, Pawit Nateenantasawasd (the middle person). He is the programmer of our team. He is quite introverted so he can focus for a very long time. On the other hand, Pongpapat Putongkam (the left person). He has a very short attention span, so he could come up with new ideas easily. He is the designer and builder of our robot. Lastly, Thanyawut Krittikanon (the right person). He is at the best of both worlds. He can program and design, so he is a supporter of the team. Our team name is YBR-BOK. 'YBR' stands for 'Yothinburana Robot Club', and 'BOK' comes from our nickname 'Book, O'ly, Kaopun'.

# Content

`Schemes` This folder contains one or more schematic diagrams in JPEG, PNG, or PDF format that depict the electromechanical components of the vehicle. These diagrams illustrate all the elements, including electronic components and motors, and show how they are interconnected.

`Source Codes` This folder includes all programming used to participate in the WRO 2024 Future Engineers Category and all the programming flowcharts.

`Team Photos` This folder includes photos of the team participating in the WRO 2024 Future Engineers Category.

`Vehicle Photos` This folder contains photos of the vehicle from all perspectives, including side and bottom views.

`video` This folder contains YouTube links that show how the robot operates to complete both missions.

# **Part 1: ROBOT DESIGN**

Last year, our design was based entirely on Lego. This year we decided to up our game and 3d print the whole thing with ABS and PLA plastic filament reinforced with metal parts and some Lego. Using 3d printed parts allows more flexibility to be implemented and makes it easy to acquire spare parts for an emergency.
Even with all of that, we will still use Lego parts to connect in a very precise area.

| Specification        | Description                  |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| Microcontroller      | ATmega2560 (8-bit)     |
| Clock Speed          | 16 MHz                 |
| Flash memory capacity| 256 KB                 |
| Operating Voltage    | 5 V                    |
| Color                | Royal blue             |
| Released in          | 2012                   |
| Weight               | 37 grams               |
| Dimensions           | 101.5mm x 53.3mm       |

It's a popular microcontroller board based on the ATmega2560 processor, featuring a large number of digital and analog I/O pins, making it suitable for complex projects that require a lot of inputs and outputs like Future Engineer. Having a lot of ports get rid of the problem that we do not have enough ports to connect 'OpenMV camera' while using 'Gyro'. This is why we trust and select Arduino Mega 2560 REV3.

The LEGO Power Functions L-Motor (88003) is favored for its compact size, quiet operation, and energy efficiency, making it ideal for integrating into intricate LEGO builds without noise concerns. Its cost-effectiveness and reliable performance further enhance its appeal, providing a balanced option for powering a variety of LEGO creations effectively. The motor comes with a dedicated port for Lego. So, we modified it to make it able to connect to the board.

- **ZX-Switch01** - We use **ZX-Switch01** to make it easy to start the program.

<img src="https://inex.co.th/home/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/zx-switch01.jpg" width="300"/><br>

Additional Details:<br>
When the switch is pressed, the DATA pin will be in logic "1" from R2, which is connected to a pull-up. When the switch is pressed, the DATA pin will be "0" because the switch creates a short circuit to ground. Current flows through the LED and R1, causing the LED to light up brightly. Additionally, the DATA pin can also serve as an input, allowing you to control the LED's on and off state as needed.
