  We are team YBR-BOK. We are a team from Yothinburana School in Bangkok, Thailand. Our team is comprised of 3 members; Pawit Nateenantasawasd, Pongpapat Putongkam, and Thanyawut Krittikanon.
For the past 4 years, we have been good friends, classmates, and teammates. Last year, our first time competing in this WRO category, we got lucky and had a chance to compete in the international round. But we are not careful enough, our rookie mistake gets us only in 8th place. This year we hope to get one more chance before the regulations change to redeem ourselves.

  Our team has 3 major positions. Firstly, Pawit Nateenantasawasd. He  is the programmer of our team. He is quite introverted so he can focus for a very long time. On the other hand, Pongpapat Putongkam. He has a very short attention span, so he could come up with new ideas easily. He is the designer and builder of our robot. Lastly, Thanyawut Krittikanon. He is at the best of both worlds. He can program and design, so he is a supporter of the team. Our team name is YBR-BOK. 'YBR' stands for 'Yothinburana Robot Club', and 'BOK' comes from our nickname 'Book, O'ly, Kaopun'.

In the first clip is a robot walking, and when it detects a red line, it will turn right. Then, the ultrasonic sensor's servo will turn left. However, if it encounters a blue line, it will turn left, and the ultrasonic sensor's servo will turn right. We use the ultrasonic sensor to determine the distance between the robot and the wall.

Round 1 - 

In the second clip, you will see that it will be similar to the first clip, but with the addition of obstacle management. In obstacle management, we will use the Pixy camera for detection. If the camera detects a green-colored block, it will turn left to avoid the block. However, if it sees a red-colored block, it will turn right to avoid the block.

Last Round -
